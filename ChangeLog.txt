                  HtmlTidyWrapper ChangeLog
========================================================================

May 2008 - code fixes for the XmlDocument generation, which did not work with the
           newly created C# and VB.NET sample code; previous use had not included
           _writing_ the generated XmlDocument tree to file and thus a few issues
           had not turned up before.
           
         - added C# and VB.NET sample applications so folks can see what the use
           of HtmlTidyWrapper might look like.
           
         - Added 64-bit built targets to libtidy.
         
         - upgraded libtidy to the latest sourceforge CVS tree.


Autumn 2007 - migration to MSVC2005; the MSVC2003 code and project are now obsoleted.


Spring 2006 - initial version; used in a few apps.
